"""
Author: Matt Tarantino
Description: This application will prompt the user to enter their home address
and using a geocoding service, will retrieve their lat and long. Then it will do
the same for the address of The White House. Once the application has both coordinate
sets, it will perform a calculation to determine the distance (in miles) between
the two addresses. It will finally return this distance to the user after rounding
to the nearest mile.
