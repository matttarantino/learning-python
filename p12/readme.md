# P12: Using Web API's and JSON

THIS ASSIGNMENT HAS BEEN CHANGED.  GOOGLE NOW CHARGES FOR USE OF THEIR GEO-CODER.  

Write and submit a program that uses the US Census [geocoding API (Links to an external site.)](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/Geocoding_Services_API.pdf) (access link for a full description of the API) to retrieve the location (latitude and longitude) of the U.S. White House (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC) and that of your local residence, and compute the approximate distance, in miles, between the two locations.

Your program can hard code the address for the White House but should ask for your address in the U.S. including street, city and state, and should report out its results in a sentence such as:

            The distance between my home and the White house is about 862 miles. 

Please round the distance to the nearest mile. 

See [http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/gis-faq-5.1.html (Links to an external site.)](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/gis-faq-5.1.html) for recommendations regarding the use of flat earth or great circle computations, but remember that you are looking for distances between  entities represented by a small location point (latitude and longitude) in the US so flat earth calculations will be acceptable.

You can check your solution against [http://www.distance-cities.com/ (Links to an external site.)](http://www.distance-cities.com/) which allows you to enter any two cities to see the distance.
