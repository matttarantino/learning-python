Python is an easy-to-learn, yet powerful programming language.  All Software Engineering students should know how to write programs in Python!

To get started:

-   Go to [https://www.py4e.com/install.php (Links to an external site.)](https://www.py4e.com/install.php) and install Python! We will use Python 3 in this course.
-   also...
-   Go to [https://www.py4e.com/book.php (Links to an external site.)](https://www.py4e.com/book.php) and download a copy of **Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3**. Free copies of the book are available in various formats including PDF, EPUB, MOBI (for Kindle), and HTML.

You might also wish to install the spyder development environment, available through Anaconda.  Go to [https://www.continuum.io/downloads (Links to an external site.)](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for instructions and downloads.

Prepare your Python environment and study chapters 1 and 2 of **Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3****.** 

Create and submit a Python script that uses at least one variable along with the *input*() and *print*() functions described in section 2.10 to read the user's first name and last name, and then print a string of the format "Hello <firstName> <lastName>".  For example, such a script when run might look like this:

    Please tell me your first name: Donald

    Please tell me your last name: Duck

    Hello Donald Duck

Every Python script you create should include at least a brief header block identifying the script's author (you!) and the purpose of the script.  You can do this very simply by placing that information within multi-line comment indicators """ of three sets of quotation marks.  For example:

```
"""Module documentation goes here
   and here
   and ...
"""
```
